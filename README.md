![A Station-i on Display](https://www.station-i.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/sw_zuweso_iguru_station-i_gruen.jpg)

STAI is a PoST (proof of space and time) cryptocurrency that was created for use with the Station-i. It is forked from [Chia's implementation](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain) and can therefore be farmed at the same time as Chia using the same plots.

## Connecting to the STAI Blockchain Network

The STAI client's node should automatically connect to other nodes in the network after a couple of minutes. However, if it remains unconnected for too long, you may try connecting to them manually.

We host an introducer node (not to be confused with a basic introducer) at `introducer.staicoin.com:1999`. Additionally, All The Blocks provides a live list of peers you can connect to yourself: https://alltheblocks.net/stai/peers
